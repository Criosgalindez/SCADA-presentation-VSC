# SCADA-presentation-VSC
Its neccesary to use the comand **pip install pygame** before using the code. Both Json are necessary for the code to work.
Here you can find a presentation created on Visual Studio Code about SCADA, said presentation is in Spanish as its my native language. 
In addition there will be atext that will have the relevant investigation used in the process of creating the presentation in multiple languages. 
Sorry if not completely accurate Chinese/Russian/German/English are not my primary languages.
